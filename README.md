## gh-pages not working?

It's because I uploaded the project without running `grunt build` the project lives inside of the
app directory. If you want to see it working download project
`cd project`
run: `grunt`
the node_modules directory should already be in the repo
if not run `npm install` to load the dependencies,
then run `grunt` and the project should be running on localhost:3333
